Secure communication
Cryptography's most obvious application is to
encrypt communications between us and another device.
It is most widely used for contact
between a server and a client system.
Web browser and web server, or email
client and email server are examples of this.

End-to-end Encryption
Email is one field that
isn't commonly used for encryption.
It is encrypted as email travels from server
to a server, and from server to server to you.
However, an administrator can read it on
the mail server and on your system.

Storing Data
We all store a large amount of data, and any data is valuable to at least the person who generated it.operating system uses encryption in some of the core components to keep passwords secret, mask certain
parts of the code, and make sure that updates and fixes are actually from the system's manufacturer.

Save passwords

Authentication of Identity
Cryptography is closely related to the password approach, and creative schemes are likely to use powerful
cryptographic methods in combination with individual physical methods and collective secrets that provide highly secure identity checks
